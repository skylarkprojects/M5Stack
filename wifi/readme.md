2) Update wifi/keys.py by inserting your wifi name and wifi password into the dispatch table between the "quote marks"


3) Insert the following code into your 'wifi/boot.py' code into the 'boot.py' file in the main directory




##### Don't forget to jump onto your wifi router and reserve the local IP so the address doesn't change every time you want to access it ;-)
